Iâ€™m **Antonio Patriarca** (he/him) and this is my blog. Iâ€™m an Italian software
developer in the VFX and Animation industry (at [Animal Logic](https://animallogic.com/)).
I have a MSc in Mathematics and a lot of interests. I will probably write about
mathematics, programming, art, cooking, data visualization... and include photos
of my beautiful cat. ðŸ˜¸
