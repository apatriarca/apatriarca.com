I recently graduated[^1] from the [*â€˜Flying Car and Autonomous Flight Engineerâ€™*](https://www.udacity.com/course/flying-car-nanodegree--nd787)
Nanodegree program at Udacity. This is my in-depth review of the course. I hope you will find it useful ðŸ˜ƒ

## Flying Cars?

Flying cars are still mostly a fantasy. There are some prototypes, but it is still unclear how the first real
ones will look like. The course is thus not really about flying cars, but it does try to teach
the theory and practice they will most likely be based on.

The course is mostly dedicated to **autonomous flying vehicles**, particularly the (small) *quadrotors*
most students may be familiar with. Most of the content is however generalizable to other rotor-based flying
vehicles. Flying cars will most likely need VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) capabilities and will thus
probably fly in this mode for at least these two phases. The last optional project is instead dedicated
to fixed wing flying which is a requirement for long distance flying.

To complete the course the student is required to complete four projects. Each project is associated to a set
of lessons and exercises that should help the student familiarise with the topics needed to complete it.
The lessons are mostly composed of small video sessions (of about 5 minutes each) and some text explanations.
Interleaved with the video lessons there is a set of exercises in Python. These exercises are based on
Jupyter notebooks the student have to complete.

The lessons generally covers much more theory than necessary to complete the projects and they are optional.
They are however well made and I think the additional topics are worth learning.

## Prerequisites

The course is quite advanced and it thus has a few prerequisites:

* *Python*. The first two projects (*Backyard Flyer* and *3D Motion Planning*) and all lesson exercises require some Python coding.
* *C++*. The last two projects (*Control of a 3D Quadrotor* and *Building an Estimator*) should be implemented in C++.
* *Basic Linear Algebra*. Some familiarity with vector and matrices is required to understand the lessons and complete the exercises.
* *Calculus*. Familiarity with taking derivatives and integrals (mostly from a physical point of view) is necessary.
* *Probability and Statistics*. It requires basic understanding of what mean, variance and probability distributions are.
* *Basic Physics*. Basic knowledge of kinematics and dynamics are required to understand the lessons.

I never took other courses in robotics or similar topics, but I am quite an expert in most of the prerequisite topics. I thus
had no problem in understanding the courses or working on the projects. I still found some project to require a lot of
experimentation and I surely found some challenges in them.

## Cost

Udacity nanodegrees are not cheap. You have the option of paying about 1000â‚¬ in a single payment or paying about 360â‚¬ each month.
Unless you think you will take four month to complete the course, I suggest paying as you go. I had the opportunity to dedicate
a lot of time to the course and it took me almost a month to complete. I suggest trying to dedicate as much time as possible to
the course to reduce its cost as it may become quite big. Having said that, I am not aware of any other course covering the same
set of topics as this one, so maybe you may still found it worthwhile to dedicate more time.

The main drawback of rushing through the course as I did is that I was unable to get the most of the career services. You have
in fact a single meeting with your advisor for each month your are enrolled and I thus only got one.

## Conclusions

My experience with the course has been generally positive. If you are interested in the topics of the course I really suggest
to give it a try. I made the following lists of what I think are the main pros and cons of the course to help you decide.

### Pros

* The course covers a lot of content that is not readily available elsewhere.
* The quality of the lessons is quite high.
* The video lessons help understand the topics better.
* The exercises using Python notebooks are well made.
* Projects reviews are sometimes useful to get additional insights.
* The career services are well made.
* There are links to research papers explaining or expanding the topics taught in the lessons.
* There is a lot of interesting optional topics.

### Cons

* The course is not cheap.
* There is a lot of optional content in the course the projects do not cover.
* Searching for information in the video lessons can be hard.
* The experience with the project reviews depends on the particular reviewer you get.
* The student community for this particular course is not particularly active.
